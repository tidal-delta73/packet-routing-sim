# packet-routing-sim

Network routing protocol simulator.

Pure-Python, no runtime dependencies.

## Usage

```bash
python3 -m packet_routing_sim version
python3 -m packet_routing_sim compute TOPOLOGY.json
python3 -m packet_routing_sim help
```

`compute` reads a static undirected link-state snapshot (a JSON object with
`nodes` and `links`) and writes per-router shortest-path forwarding tables
(Dijkstra; equal-metric ties break to the smaller next-hop name) as JSON to
standard output.
